# Image-Compression-using-NMF
An application of using nonnegative matrix compression on Image Compression
In the age of big data explosion, it is very essential to
handle large amounts of data accurately. If we take non-negative values, then it is not possible to perform analysis
with classical tools as they would not guarantee to remain
non-negative. In this connection, a non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF) can be applied, since it provides a low-rank approximation of the target matrix, while also
extracting its significant values. This report presents
theoretical details about NMF, the main numerical
algorithm and implemented Python code used to solve the
image compression problem, and an overview of the most
recent experimental applications in the field of image
processing.
